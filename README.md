# Hello! I'm Anton.

I'm learning programming and have embarked on the path of frontend development. I enjoy connecting users with interfaces, making this connection logical and functional. I'm also passionate about cars. Many people say there's something wrong with me because I usually buy used cars and upgrade them, expanding their features. Friends ask why I don't just buy a car with the maximum configuration right away. But where's the fun in that?

Even though the journey is long and challenging, I never give up! I'm always open to new knowledge and actively seek it out.
